# 📈 ML-Based Equity Momentum Strategy using LightGBM

This project implements a machine learning-driven momentum strategy for stock selection using technical indicators and LightGBM. It focuses on monthly ranking of NSE-100 stocks to generate actionable buy/sell signals, with custom backtesting and performance analytics.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

- **Objective**: Predict top-performing stocks based on recent momentum and technical indicators.
- **Universe**: NSE-100 stocks, 2019–2024 data.
- **Approach**: Use LightGBM to rank stocks by predicted forward returns.
- **Backtest Logic**: Buy top-N ranked stocks monthly, equal-weighted, with transaction cost and cumulative capital tracking.

---

## 🧠 Features & Engineering

- 12+ Technical Indicators:
  - RSI, MACD, ATR, EMA, Momentum, etc.
- Forward return labeling:
  - Based on 21-day future return.
- Monthly cross-sectional classification:  
  - Stocks are labeled as outperforming (+1), underperforming (−1), or neutral (0, optionally dropped).

---

## 🔍 Model

- **Model**: LightGBM Classifier
- **Task**: Multiclass classification (−1, 0, +1) or binary (dropping 0)
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: RandomizedSearchCV
- **Validation**: Time-aware train-test split (by month)
